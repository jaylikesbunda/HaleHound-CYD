# HaleHound-CYD

**Multi-protocol offensive security toolkit for the ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display**

Version **v3.5.5** | By [JesseCHale](https://github.com/JesseCHale) | [HaleHound.com](https://halehound.com)

---

## What Is This

40+ attack modules across WiFi, Bluetooth, SubGHz, 2.4GHz, and NFC — all running on a $7 touchscreen dev board. External CC1101, NRF24L01+PA+LNA, PN532, and GPS modules plug into the CYD's breakout pins. Everything is touch-driven. All radios transmit at maximum power. No safety nets.

---

## Supported Boards

| Board | Build Target | Display | Touch | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------|--------|
| ESP32-2432S028 (2.8") | `esp32-cyd` | ILI9341 240x320 | XPT2046 Resistive | Fully Tested |
| QDtech E32R35T (3.5") | `esp32-e32r35t` | ST7796 320x480 | XPT2046 Resistive | Fully Tested |
| QDtech E32R28T (2.8") | `esp32-e32r28t` | ILI9341 240x320 | XPT2046 Resistive | Fully Tested |
| NM-RF-Hat (2.8") | `esp32-cyd-hat` | ILI9341 240x320 | XPT2046 Resistive | Supported |

All UI scales automatically between 240x320 and 320x480. Pick your board, flash, done.

---

## Hardware

### Required

| Module | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| CYD board (any above) | Base platform — ESP32 + touchscreen + SD card |
| CC1101 (HW-863 or E07-433M20S) | SubGHz radio: 300-928 MHz capture, replay, jam, brute force |
| NRF24L01+PA+LNA | 2.4GHz radio: BLE jam, WLAN jam, MouseJack, spectrum analysis |
| PN532 V3 (Elechouse, SPI mode) | NFC/RFID: card scan, read, clone, brute force, emulate |
| GPS (GT-U7 or NEO-6M) | Wardriving, Flock You geolocation, live satellite view |

### Also Required: Independent 3.3V Power for Ebyte Modules

The Ebyte PA modules (E07-433M20S and E01-2G4M27SX) draw too much current for the CYD's onboard 3.3V regulator. You **must** power them from a separate 5V→3.3V buck converter. Tap 5V from USB and step it down to 3.3V independently — do not share the CYD's 3.3V rail or you'll get brownouts, random resets, and failed radio init.

| Part | Example |
|------|---------|
| 5V→3.3V buck converter | AMS1117-3.3 module, MP2307, or any 3.3V reg rated 500mA+ |
| Input | 5V from USB VBUS (before the CYD's regulator) |
| Output | 3.3V to E07 VCC and E01 VCC independently |
| Ground | Common ground with CYD — all GNDs must tie together |

The signal wires (SPI, CS, CE, GDO0, GDO2, TX_EN, RX_EN) still connect directly to ESP32 GPIOs — only VCC gets the independent supply.

### Optional

| Component | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| E07-433M20S PA module | 20dBm amplified SubGHz — serious range upgrade over stock CC1101 |
| 10uF capacitor | Across NRF24 VCC/GND — stops random resets on PA+LNA modules |
| MicroSD card (FAT32) | Loot storage, .sub files, wardriving logs, OTA updates |
| LiPo battery + boost | Portable operation |

## Feature Highlights

### WiFi

All WiFi attacks use the ESP32's built-in radio — no external hardware. APSTA mode: STA scans, AP injects raw frames. Max TX at +20.5 dBm.

- **Deauther** — Scan, tap a target, flood deauth frames. WiFi Scanner has tap-to-deauth built in.
- **Probe Sniffer → Evil Twin** — Capture what devices are looking for, then become that network. Auto-spawns GARMR captive portal with the probed SSID.
- **Auth Flood** — Random MAC auth frame flood. Exhausts AP client tables. 85-bar equalizer shows attack rhythm.
- **Captive Portal (GARMR)** — Fake AP + DNS hijack + credential harvest page. Works standalone or chained from Probe Sniffer / WiFi Scanner.

### Bluetooth

All BLE uses the ESP32's built-in Bluetooth. Proper WiFi↔BLE radio teardown handled automatically.

- **BLE Predator** — Three phases: SCAN (discover + threat classify), RECON (GATT enumerate all services/chars), HONEYPOT (clone as connectable server, capture credentials on WRITE). Loot saved to SD.
- **Airoha RACE** — CVE-2025-20700/20701/20702. Unauthenticated BLE GATT access to Airoha chipsets (Sony XM4/XM5/XM6, Marshall, JBL, Jabra, etc). Extracts Bluetooth link keys, BD_ADDR, firmware version, flash memory. No pairing required.
- **WhisperPair** — CVE-2025-36911. Probes Google Fast Pair devices for unauthorized pairing vulnerability.
- **Lunatic Fringe** — Hub for tracker detection and attacks. Scans for AirTags, Samsung SmartTags, Tile, Chipolo, Google FMDN. Phantom Flood spams fake FindMy trackers. AirTag Replay clones real AirTag identities.

### 2.4GHz (NRF24)

External NRF24L01+PA+LNA required. All modes at RF24_PA_MAX (+20 dBm with PA module).

- **NRF Sniffer** — Travis Goodspeed promiscuous mode. Captures raw packets from wireless keyboards, mice, drones. Tap a captured address → auto-populates MouseJack.
- **MouseJack** — Keystroke injection into Logitech Unifying, Dell, Microsoft wireless keyboards. HID++ packets, pre-built payloads (reverse shell, WiFi exfil, custom string).
- **WLAN Jammer / Proto Kill** — Broadband 2.4GHz disruption. Affects WiFi, BLE, Zigbee, wireless peripherals, drones.

### SubGHz (CC1101)

External CC1101 required. All TX at setPA(12) max power. Optional E07-433M20S PA module for 20dBm amplified output.

- **Replay Attack** — Record and replay SubGHz signals. RSSI gating, drain loop, repeat validation. Save profiles to SD.
- **Brute Force** — Automated code generation with de Bruijn sequences. Princeton, CAME, Nice FLO, PT2262.
- **Tesla Charge** — Opens the charge port on any Tesla. Static 43-byte OOK payload, zero authentication, zero rolling code. Works on every Tesla ever made. US (315 MHz), EU (433.92 MHz), or both.
- **.Sub Read** — Browse and transmit Flipper Zero .sub files from SD card. Supports RAW, Princeton, CAME, Nice FLO across full CC1101 frequency range. No .sub files required — shows empty state if folder is missing. Drop files in `/subghz/` when you have them.

### RFID (PN532)

External PN532 V3 in SPI mode. Scan, read, clone, brute force, and emulate MIFARE Classic cards.

### Jam Detect

Defensive modules. WiFi Guardian catches deauth floods, SubGHz Sentinel detects carrier jamming, 2.4GHz Watchdog spots broadband disruption, Full Spectrum monitors all bands at once.

### SIGINT

- **EAPOL Capture** — WPA 4-way handshake + PMKID extraction. Deauth to force reauth, capture, save in hashcat format.
- **Karma Attack** — Auto-respond to every probe request, chain into captive portal for credential harvest.
- **IoT Recon** — Connect to WiFi, scan the subnet, fingerprint services (HTTP, RTSP, Telnet, MQTT, Modbus, XMEye), brute force default credentials. Dual-core: networking on Core 0, UI on Core 1. Drop custom creds in `/creds.txt` on SD.
- **Flock You** — Passive detection of Flock Safety ALPR cameras and Raven/ShotSpotter sensors via BLE fingerprinting. 22 OUI prefixes, 8 Raven GATT service UUIDs, firmware version estimation. GPS-tagged saves to SD.
- **Loot** — Unified browser for all captured data: wardriving CSVs, EAPOL handshakes, WhisperPair/BLE Predator loot, IoT Recon reports, credentials.

### VALHALLA Protocol

Every offensive module is gated behind a liability disclaimer. Accept to unlock offensive tools, decline to enter **Blue Team mode** — defensive and passive modules only. Blue Team mode persists across reboots. The VALHALLA/BLUE TEAM banner on the home screen shows your current mode.

---

## Wiring

All external radios share the VSPI bus (GPIO 18/19/23) with the built-in SD card. Only one device talks at a time — the SPI manager handles bus arbitration automatically.

Full pin mapping, wiring diagrams, and board-specific differences are in `cyd_config.h`. The Radio Test module (Tools > Radio Test) includes 4-page visual wiring diagrams for every radio.

### Quick Reference

| Module | CS Pin | Extra Pins |
|--------|--------|------------|
| CC1101 | GPIO 27 (2.8") / GPIO 21 (E32R35T) | GDO0=22 (TX), GDO2=35 (RX) |
| NRF24 | GPIO 4 (2.8") / GPIO 26 (E32R28T/E32R35T) | CE=16 |
| PN532 | GPIO 17 | SPI mode (DIP: CH1=OFF, CH2=ON) |
| SD Card | GPIO 5 | Built into CYD board |
| GPS | — | TX→GPIO 3 (P1 connector, shared with USB RX) |

**E07 PA Module:** Enable in Settings > CC1101 Module. TX_EN on GPIO 4, RX_EN on GPIO 0. E32R28T/E32R35T only. **Must be powered from an independent 5V→3.3V buck converter** — not the CYD's 3.3V rail. Same applies to the NRF24 E01-2G4M27SX.

**Note:** CiferTech's original firmware had CC1101 TX/RX pins swapped. HaleHound corrects this — GDO0 is TX (to radio), GDO2 is RX (from radio).

---

## SD Card

FAT32 formatted MicroSD. Nothing is required — every module handles missing folders gracefully.

```
/sd/
├── subghz/         .sub files for Sub Read (organize into subfolders)
├── eapol/          EAPOL/PMKID captures
├── wardriving/     GPS-tagged AP logs
├── wp_loot/        WhisperPair + BLE Predator loot
├── loot/           Flock You detection logs
├── creds.txt       Custom credentials for IoT Recon (optional)
├── iot_recon.txt   IoT Recon attack reports
└── firmware/       OTA update .bin files
```

---

## Flash — Pre-Compiled Binaries

Pre-built firmware is in the `flash_package/` folder. One binary per board.

### Easiest Method

Flash `HaleHound-<board>-FULL.bin` at address `0x0`.

### Web Flasher (No Install)

1. Open [esp.huhn.me](https://esp.huhn.me) in Chrome/Edge/Opera
2. Connect → select your CYD serial port
3. Set address `0x0`, select the FULL.bin for your board
4. Program → power cycle

### esptool

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32 --baud 115200 write_flash 0x0 HaleHound-CYD-FULL.bin
```

### Four-File Method (Fallback)

If single-file gives a black screen:

| Address | File |
|---------|------|
| `0x1000` | `bootloader.bin` |
| `0x8000` | `partitions.bin` |
| `0xe000` | `boot_app0.bin` |
| `0x10000` | `HaleHound-<board>.bin` |

### First Boot

Touch calibration runs automatically on first boot. Tap the 4 corner crosshairs. If display orientation is wrong, fix it in Settings > Rotation — no reflash needed.

### CH340 Driver

CYD boards use CH340 USB serial. Install if your computer doesn't see the board:
- **Windows:** [CH341SER.EXE](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_EXE.html)
- **macOS:** [CH341SER_MAC.ZIP](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_MAC_ZIP.html)
- **Linux:** Built into kernel 5.x+

---

## Build from Source

```bash
# Install PlatformIO, plug in CYD, then:

pio run -e esp32-cyd --target upload          # 2.8" CYD
pio run -e esp32-e32r35t --target upload      # E32R35T 3.5"
pio run -e esp32-e32r28t --target upload      # E32R28T
pio run -e esp32-cyd-hat --target upload      # NM-RF-Hat

# Serial monitor
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

Requires Python 3.10-3.13 (3.14 needs a platform.py patch).

---

## TX Power

Every attack radio runs at max.

| Radio | Power |
|-------|-------|
| WiFi (ESP32) | +20.5 dBm |
| NRF24+PA+LNA | +20 dBm |
| CC1101 | +12 dBm (stock) / +20 dBm (E07 PA) |
| BLE (ESP32) | +9 dBm |

---

## Known Issues

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| NRF24 random resets | Solder 10uF cap across VCC/GND at module |
| GPS shares GPIO 3 with USB serial | Firmware handles this — Serial.end() during GPS |
| Display upside-down after flash | Settings > Rotation |
| Touch offset after flash | Auto-calibrates first boot, or Tools > Touch Calibrate |
| Python 3.14 breaks PlatformIO | Use 3.10-3.13 or patch platform.py |
